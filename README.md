# XMT: eXtensible Malware Toolkit

XMT is a framework written in Golang that allows for target/endpoint control and data exfil.

This framework also includes a C2 server.

XMT will support multiple Operating Systems and will have low level (kernal and DLL) compatibility with the major targeted Operating Systems.

This is a current work in progress.
