# XMT: eXtensible Malware Toolkit

XMT is a framework written in Golang that allows for target/endpoint control and data exfil.

This framework also includes a C2 server.

XMT will support multiple Operating Systems and will have low level (kernel and DLL) compatibility with the major targeted Operating Systems.

This is a current work in progress.

## TODO

These are soem things I need to work on.

- (Idea?) Should we update "c2/schedule.go" to indicate when a Task is read and accepted by a client? (DONE!)
- RPC Server
- Windows Auto-Builder scripts for DLL types
